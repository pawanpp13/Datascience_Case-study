#There is one data set of advertisement agency.

Dataset contains multiple records about the customers who invest in multiple advertisement
options.Depends on that sales feature indicates the the increased amount in there sales

This data set contains 4 features as
TV
Radio
Television
Depends on the above three features Sales feature indicates the increased sale amount.
We have to design Machine Learning application which uses Classification
technique.

In this case we have to define our own linear regression algorithm.
Display value of R square for trained data.


Performing Simple Linear Regression
Equation of linear regression
y=c+m1x1+m2x2+...+mnxn 
y  is the response
c  is the intercept
m1  is the coefficient for the first feature
mn  is the coefficient for the nth feature
In our case:

y=c+m1Ã—TV 
The  m  values are called the model coefficients or model parameters.
