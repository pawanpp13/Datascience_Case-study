# There is one data set which contains information about Head and Brain.

data set contains information about Head and brain size depends on gender and age.

Linear Regression model are used to show or predict the relationship between a dependent variable (target variable) and independent variable(s). It can be used to check if there exists any correlation between the variables.

Simple Linear Regression -> relationship between just two variables (a dependent Vs an independent)
Multiple Regression -> relationship between two or more variables ( a dependent Vs 2 or more independent)
The current data set in an example of Simple Linear Regression. We have a target or the dependent variable,which is Brain Weight. The independent variable here is the Head Size.

The formula goes like this -

y = mx+c

Where ,

c - is the y-intercept

m - is the slope / coefficient -> this quantity effects the values of y

In our example -

BrainWeight = m * HeadSize + constant

constant = BrainWeight - (m * HeadSize)
