#Diabetes Predictor

In this project, our objective is to predict whether the patient has diabetes or not based on various features like Glucose level, Insulin, Age, BMI.
We will perform all the steps from Data gathering to Model deployment. During Model evaluation, 
we compare various machine learning algorithms on the basis of accuracy_score metric and find the best one.


we used the 4 algorithms like Supervised algorithm knn,decisiontree,logistic regression and one is unsupervised Random Forest algorithm used for the predict best Accurate values
and observed wich is best model to predict best score.
